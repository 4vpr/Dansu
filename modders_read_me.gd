# To modders
# This game's code is messy because I am a beginner developer 
# and I made this project while learning Godot for the first time.
# There are many areas that are incomplete or not very polished.
# I hope for your understanding.
# If you have any suggestions or improvements, please DM me on Discord at h4yase.
# Thank you also for taking the time and interest to look through my game's inner workings.a
